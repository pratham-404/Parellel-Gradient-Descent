**Gradient descent** is a popular optimization algorithm used to minimize or maximize an objective function. It is commonly used in machine learning, data science, and optimization problems.It works by iteratively adjusting the parameters of a model or the variables of an objective function in the direction of steepest descent (or ascent) of the function. It leverages the gradient (a vector of partial derivatives) to determine the direction of the steepest slope and takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient to reach the minimum (or maximum) of the function.
